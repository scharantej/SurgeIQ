## Flask Application Design for the Landing Page

### HTML Files

- **`index.html`**: The main landing page that displays the MVP's information and features a call-to-action. The HTML content should include:
    - Attention-grabbing **headline** highlighting the value proposition of the MVP.
    - **Subheadline** providing more details and elaborating on the headline.
    - **Call-to-action** button or link that encourages visitors to take the next step, such as signing up or downloading the MVP.
    - **Images and videos** showcasing the MVP's features and functionality.
    - **Testimonials** from beta users or early adopters, providing credibility and social proof.
    - **Social media links** for sharing and following the MVP's updates.
- **`about.html`**: An optional page that provides more in-depth information about the MVP's mission, team, and values.

### Routes

- **`/`**: The root route that renders the `index.html` landing page.
- **`/about`**: The route for the `about.html` page, providing additional information about the MVP.

### Additional Notes

- The landing page should be designed with a clear and visually appealing layout, using elements such as headings, lists, and images to make the information easy to scan and understand.
- The call-to-action should be prominent and encourage visitors to engage with the MVP, such as signing up for a trial or downloading a free version.
- The HTML content should be optimized for search engines (SEO) by utilizing relevant keywords and meta tags to improve the page's visibility in search results.
